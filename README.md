# Inclusive Web Performance and CX

This project contains research around web performance in the federal government to help hone in on a potential solution that can work at a large scale.

Currently, this project has a `research` directory that uses publicly available data sources to see where the gaps are in the current monitoring strategy for federal sites and applications, particularly for those users who might be on low or mid-tier mobile devices and/or limited data plans.
